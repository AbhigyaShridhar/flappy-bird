# flappy-bird
This is my implementaion of the classic "flappy bird" game. 
The source code is derived from CS50's game developement track.
### The changes for leveling up and showing medals have been made in "PlayState.lua" file

The difficulty level of the game can be increased by decreasing "GAP_HEIGHT" value in the PipePair.lua file.
